# zocdoc-monitor

I don't know if they rate limit, raise delay to be safe if not using proxies

Fill locations array with all provider locations you'd like to monitor (search "data-location-id" on Zocdoc search results page's html)

Basic support won't be provided if you don't know how to run this

Fill in Discord webhook information if you'd like discord notifications
